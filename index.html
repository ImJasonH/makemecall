  <h2>An Update on Make Me Call</h2>

  <p>Make Me Call is no longer available. In the 3 months the service was live,
  it helped 117 users make more than 1,800 calls to their representatives.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the costs of running the service were just too high, and I
  can no longer afford to keep it running. If you are interested in taking
  over, please <a href="mailto:admin@makemecall.org">contact me</a> and I can
  transfer it over to you. You can also check out the source on <a
  href="https://github.com/imjasonh/makemecall">GitHub</a></p>

  <h2>Don't stop now!</h2>

  <p>There are still <i>plenty</i> of reasons to call your representatives,
  maybe more than ever. Hopefully Make Me Call has helped you develop a habit
  of calling every day, or at least made it easier to get motivated. Use the <a
  href="https://5calls.org">5calls</a> app to keep the streak alive!</p>

  <p>Thank you, and keep those calls coming.</p>
